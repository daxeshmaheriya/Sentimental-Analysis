# Sentiental-Analysis

This repository contains the code and resources for the Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews project. We utilized two different approaches: VADER and RoBERTa pre-trained models to analyze the sentiment of product reviews from Amazon. The results provide sentiment classification into neutral, positive, and negative categories, allowing for a detailed comparison between the two methods.

**Project Overview**
        The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon product reviews to understand customer feedback. We compare the performance of the VADER sentiment analysis tool and the RoBERTa pre-trained model, both of which are widely used for natural language processing tasks.

**Methodologies**
1. VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner)
        VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. It is fast and efficient for classifying sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.
2.RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)
        RoBERTa is a variant of the BERT model, pre-trained on a large corpus of text data. It is fine-tuned for sentiment analysis tasks and can capture more nuanced sentiments in text compared to traditional lexicon-based methods.
